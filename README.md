# Davidson algorithm
Iterative diagonalization methods:
1) Power iteration
2) Block Davidson method

   The Block Davidson method ca be used to solve for 
a number of the lowest or highest few Eigenvalues of a 
symmetric matrix. 

   Power iteration is used to find the highest eigenvalue 
one at a time.
